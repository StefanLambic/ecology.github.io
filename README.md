The name of this project is Ecology.
The project is made using multiple tools such as JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5, Sass while following BEM methodology.
An idea was to make a website for spreading awareness of pollution in Balkans region. 
In this project i have designed and implemented slider (carousel) using Vanilla Javascript (no frameworks).
I have improved my skills writing JavaScript and more clean CSS code while making this project.
